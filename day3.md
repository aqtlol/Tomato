# Day 3
October 8. 2022

**Lets have a great day!**
## Pomdoro #1 🍅
Getting into a good groove is always nice. The pomodoro method really just helps me start up. I don't really any motivation other than myself to get strated working. As soon as that timer starts I am going and my brain is firing. With this first pomodoro I finished one of the 3 assignments I wanted to get done today. Lets go!
