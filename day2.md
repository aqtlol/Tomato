# Day 2
October 6. 2022

**Start of another great day lets see what we will accomplish today**
## Pomodoro #1 🍅
* Stepik 4.1 read through and took notes
## Pomodoro #2 🍅🍅
* Stepik 4.2
* Stepik 4.3
* Took some good intesive notes which is good for learning and looking back on

Kind of went a little overtime on this one but I was really focused on my note taking so I needed it. Not sure if I should start a new pomodoro when I am still in the zone or not and then take a double break. I'll need to do some research into that or just try it out myself.
## Pomodoro #3 🍅🍅🍅
* Halfway through stepik 4.4

Lots to unpack in today's stepiks. Going over linked lists so I am learning a lot that I do not know. Stepik 4.4 goes over the adding in new nodes to your linked list. Making good notes is important so I can go over them later if necessary.
## Pomodoro #4 🍅🍅🍅🍅
