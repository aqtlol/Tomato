# Tomato 🍅🍅🍅
## This is a website I will create to track my pomodoro's(tomatos)🍅

My pomodoro's are 25 min focus periods for me to complete work and tasks. Recently I have found myself way to distracted and not able to properly manage focus time. I am a student in college trying to create himself through self-discovery. I think the pomodoro method will greatly help me manage my time and by keeping this log of when I finish each of my pomodoro's I will be able to look back on all the work I've accomplished and thank myself for sticking through it.

This website is made also to challenge myself in order to code more and get more familiar with github and coding in general.

Enjoy my journey for those of you reading!🍅
