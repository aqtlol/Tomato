# Day 3
October 8. 2022

**Lets have a great day!**
## Pomdoro #1 🍅
Getting into a good groove is always nice. The pomodoro method really just helps me start up. I don't really any motivation other than myself to get strated working. As soon as that timer starts I am going and my brain is firing. With this first pomodoro I finished one of the 3 assignments I wanted to get done today. Lets go!
* Grading Contract WCWP 10B

## Pomdoro #2 🍅🍅
Got a little distracted helping Isabelle with UCSD applications. I know that I should always be willing to help others, but one must take care of his or her own prorities before helping someone else. However, this a common ethical dilema I face everyday I feel like. Help others or help myself. I am learning everyday as I go. But as I stand now I do think that I need to create myself first before allowing others into my life. By creating myself, those who like me will stick and those who don't can leave. I can create a beautiful image that portrays me truly. Anyways, what did i do?
* Read Seek and Speak your Truth for my project #4

Now that I read the prompt for this project. I am not sure if this reading is best for the prompt. But I do feel that I really needed to read this and I am going to finish the reading.
