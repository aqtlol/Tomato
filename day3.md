# Day 3
October 8. 2022

**Lets have a great day!**
## Pomdoro #1 🍅
Getting into a good groove is always nice. The pomodoro method really just helps me start up. I don't really any motivation other than myself to get strated working. As soon as that timer starts I am going and my brain is firing. With this first pomodoro I finished one of the 3 assignments I wanted to get done today. Lets go!
* Grading Contract WCWP 10B

## Pomdoro #2 🍅🍅
Got a little distracted helping Isabelle with UCSD applications. I know that I should always be willing to help others, but one must take care of his or her own prorities before helping someone else. However, this a common ethical dilema I face everyday I feel like. Help others or help myself. I am learning everyday as I go. But as I stand now I do think that I need to create myself first before allowing others into my life. By creating myself, those who like me will stick and those who don't can leave. I can create a beautiful image that portrays me truly. Anyways, what did i do?
* Read Seek and Speak your Truth for my project #4

Now that I read the prompt for this project. I am not sure if this reading is best for the prompt. But I do feel that I really needed to read this and I am going to finish the reading.

## Pomodoro #3 🍅🍅🍅
* Finished reading Seek and Speak Your Truth

After reading this I feel that while it may not help me for the project I have to write at hand I found this reading greatly helpful for my personal life. I feel like hoensty and free speach is something very important to when it comes to being human and making good relationships. These 2 seem to disapearring as people want to appear polite. I am going to use what I learned from reading to establish better relationships with my friends, especially my best friends. I am actually on the way to talk to Jackie right now and I can't wait to just have a talk with her, it's been a while since we have talked her and I.
