# Day 2
October 6. 2022

**Start of another great day lets see what we will accomplish today**
## Pomodoro #1 🍅
* Stepik 4.1 read through and took notes
## Pomodoro #2 🍅🍅
* Stepik 4.2
* Stepik 4.3
* Took some good intesive notes which is good for learning and looking back on

Kind of went a little overtime on this one but I was really focused on my note taking so I needed it. Not sure if I should start a new pomodoro when I am still in the zone or not and then take a double break. I'll need to do some research into that or just try it out myself.
## Pomodoro #3 🍅🍅🍅
* Halfway through stepik 4.4

Lots to unpack in today's stepiks. Going over linked lists so I am learning a lot that I do not know. Stepik 4.4 goes over the adding in new nodes to your linked list. Making good notes is important so I can go over them later if necessary.
## Pomodoro #4 🍅🍅🍅🍅
God damn this stepik is taking a while!
* Stepik 4.4
* Stepik 4.5

This is definitley the most amount of notes that I have taken for a stepiks because there is a lot to unpack but I can tell that I am definitley learning. I am acing the activities on there so I can tell you all about a linked list thanks to my studying. Should be able to knock this out on the next pomodoro. I also got interupted during this pomodoro becasue Jackie and Hartej got to the library so I restarted my timer to get back into the flow state.
## Pomodoro #5 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
This took a while goddamn ahaha
* Finished all of chapter 4 stepiks
* Started chapter 9 stepiks

For this pomodoro there were lots of interuptions because of constant motion. Me and my friends at the library were constantly getting up and moving to a new spot. Then it was hard to get into the swing of things again because we were talking for a bit but I restarted my timer and was able to focus up and finish what I needed to. I didn't think this stepik would take my whole day today but it really did. Then again my whole day was not 5 pomodoros so maybe I need to reavluate how I spend my time.

## Reflect
Technically the following day when I am writing this. I had open gym for volleyball so I got home late. I was hoping to get a lot more done today but unfortunately it did not happen. But it is okay because I did get the stepiks done and I have become motivated to show up to cse 12 class tomorrow. After seeing this I can see that despite feeling like I worked a lot today I only completed 5 pomodoros. If we do the math thats 125 mins of work. Actually I lied that is kind of a lot ahaha, a bit over 2 hours. I am kind of proud. I know that I can do more and splitting my time like this makes it feel like a game. I want to comlete more pomodoros, as many as I can. This weekend will be a grind, tomorrow will be rest.

I also want to start implementing at least one music pomodoro everyday on any musically related task. This could be playing guitar, producing, or learning music theory, anything related works. I feel like one a day will succesfully keep me disciplined and on the right course to achieving my dreams.
