## Pomodoro #1 🍅
Woah that was crazy! The amount of work I was able to complete in 25 minutes was bizarre to me. I have never actually focused up that much in my life. Right now Im writing my little entry before my 5 minute break but woah. I am amazed by the power of focus. In this time period of 25 minutes I was able to
> * Start this github project
> * Create the read me, index, and day 1
> * Start some of my persual annotations

I can't wait to see how much of a positive impact this has on my life. And I can't wait to look back on it all here!
