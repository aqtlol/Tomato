**Lets grind**
## Pomodoro #1 üçÖ
Dang I got super side tracked with my work today. I wanted to start this pomodoro at 5 and actually took a nap and fell asleep for an hour and a half. Then I went outside with my sister and looked at the beautiful moon. Now I finally got the chance to work and read through the article I am going to write my project on:
* On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs
* Wrote out some bullet points to guide my ideas

I didn't like the author and his tone of voice. It gave me a privileged arrogant feel. I can't wait to expose the false ideas of meritocracy in his work.

## Reflect 
Today I did not really work with the pomodoro method. It was getting late after 11 and I feel like I just grinded until right now. I just worked and kept working with music and I got into a good focused zone that I am still in. I might keep taking advantage of this state. I guess I am more of a night time studier, but I also have been going to bed really late this weekend and took a nap earlier today so maybe my sleep scedule is a little screwed up. I feel like I am finally catching up to being almost caught up. Just have to watch some lectures and do my PA's for CSE 12 and I will be all caught up! Wish me luck :)
