## Pomodoro #1 🍅
Woah that was crazy! The amount of work I was able to complete in 25 minutes was bizarre to me. I have never actually focused up that much in my life. Right now Im writing my little entry before my 5 minute break but woah. I am amazed by the power of focus. In this time period of 25 minutes I was able to
* Start this github project
* Create the read me, index, and day 1
* Start some of my persual annotations

I can't wait to see how much of a positive impact this has on my life. And I can't wait to look back on it all here!

## Pomodoro #2 🍅🍅
Number 2 done! What did I do?
* Finished first perusal reading
* Half way done through second perusal

I should finish up my persuals by the next and final pomodoro for the night. I have decided to start sleeping earlier to see if morning study works better for me compared to night time study.
