# Day 1

## Pomodoro #1 🍅
Woah that was crazy! The amount of work I was able to complete in 25 minutes was bizarre to me. I have never actually focused up that much in my life. Right now Im writing my little entry before my 5 minute break but woah. I am amazed by the power of focus. In this time period of 25 minutes I was able to
* Start this github project
* Create the read me, index, and day 1
* Start some of my persual annotations

I can't wait to see how much of a positive impact this has on my life. And I can't wait to look back on it all here!

## Pomodoro #2 🍅🍅
Number 2 done! What did I do?
* Finished first perusal reading
* Half way done through second perusal

I should finish up my persuals by the next and final pomodoro for the night. I have decided to start sleeping earlier to see if morning study works better for me compared to night time study.

## Pomodoro #3 🍅🍅🍅
Final Pomodoro for the day I think. What we do?
* Finish up our perusal readings
* Link this page to the [Index](index.html)

## Reflect
I feel really good about myself. I accomplished in a short time. Focus power is amazing. I know that you should reward yourself after 3 or 4 pomodoros with a 30 minute break. I think I might take up this break playing a game of League of Legends. After all I don't want to turn into a robot worker that only does work. I am doing this method in order to have more time to things I enjoy by using pomodoro to focus and complete tasks. Overall I am really happy with how tonight turned out. Lets see how this project goes! 🍅 :)
