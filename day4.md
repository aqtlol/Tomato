**Lets grind**
## Pomodoro #1 🍅
Dang I got super side tracked with my work today. I wanted to start this pomodoro at 5 and actually took a nap and fell asleep for an hour and a half. Then I went outside with my sister and looked at the beautiful moon. Now I finally got the chance to work and read through the article I am going to write my project on:
* On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs
* Wrote out some bullet points to guide my ideas

I didn't like the author and his tone of voice. It gave me a privileged arrogant feel. I can't wait to expose the false ideas of meritocracy in his work.
